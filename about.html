                <h4 class="post-subtitle">
                <p>Growing up in the musical hotbed of the northeast, West Seneca, NY, Saccomanno was exposed to a wide range of music as a child. His parents bought him a trumpet on his 14th birthday which the young aspiring musician soon traded for a Zenith acoustic guitar. As a teenager he became involved in the skiffle craze. His first band, the Quarrymen, eventually evolved into the edgy, hard rock band Jonas Grumby. In 2005, Grumby released the critically acclaimed album Wireboy. After a short stint as a solo artist, Saccomanno joined the Barenaked Ladies tribute band, Fully Clothed Gents. When the group disbanded in 2014, Saccomanno embarked on his lifeâ€™s dream to work as an accountant. He soon found this new lifestyle to be unsatisfying, however, and through ironic turn of events, Saccomanno re-emerged on the music scene with the newly formed Rock Angel Band in late 2014 and has never looked back.</p>
